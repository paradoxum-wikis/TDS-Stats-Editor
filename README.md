# Tower Defense Simulator Statistics Editor

A forked version that aims to keep the editor up to date, featuring numerous quality of life improvements, primarily due to its support for the **TDS Wiki**. (Hopefully more to come in the future, lolol.)

The repository is a monorepo, hosting not only the Statistics Editor itself, but also other tools such as the Randomizer, Skills Planner, and etc.

## FAQ

### Will there be new features?

Yes, there are a few on the backburner, bug fixes have the highest priority.

### How long will it be supported?

I can make no guarantees that it'd be forever updated, although I do expect it to be around for quite a while. Even if it were to shut down, due to the nature of it being open source, anyone can contribute directly to it or make forks of the site. (Like what I did, duhuhu.)

### I want to suggest something, how should I contact you?

Direct messages on Discord are preferred (my user is t7ru), though there are multiple ways you can contact me and any of them are fine.

There are also discussions and updates about this editor on the #stat-editor channel of the Tower Defense Simulator Wiki [server](https://discord.com/invite/fBgQzudY3h). Unfortunately, you will need a FANDOM account to access it, so make one if you're interested.

### Is this official?

Absolutely not, this editor is in no way officially affiliated with Paradoxum Games, and therefore, Tower Defense Simulator.
